***6.1. A contiguous subsequence of a list S is a subsequence made up of consecutive elements of S. For
instance, if S is***

***5 ,15 ,-30 ,10 ,-5, 40, 10***

***then 15 ,-30 10 is a contiguous subsequence but 5, 15, 40 is not. Give a linear-time algorithm for
the following task:***


***Input: A list of numbers, a1, a2, . . . ., an.***


***Output: The contiguous subsequence of maximum sum (a subsequence of length zerhas sum zero).***


***For the preceding example, the answer would be 10;􀀀5; 40; 10, with a sum of 55.
(Hint: For each j Ꞓ {1,2,……n}, consider contiguous subsequences ending exactly at position j.)***




Solution: The problem can be solved through greedy algorithm.
Since the linear time algorithm is required and it always want the contigious subsequence then we follow this approach
initialize two variables
This can be easily done through dynamic programming.
The optimal substructure here is this that ***5 ,15 ,-30 ,10 ,-5, 40, 10*** consider this example;
Now lets say that we just want to find the max till A[:1] then max=5,, similarly for A[:2] then max=5+15=20, 
similarly for A[:3]; max=5+15=20. For A[:4] max=5+15=20 for A[:5]=15+5=20,For A[:6] we see that we get the number much larger
the best sum till A[:5] hence for A[:6

The optimal substructure in this problem is this that we have base case A[:1]=A[1] or A[0] if you are starting with index 0
So generally MaxSUM(A[i+1])=max(MaxSum(A[i])+A[i+1], A[i])  with basecase that MaxSUM(A[0])=0

Let A be the Array
A=[5,15,-30,10,-5,40,10]
#MAX_TILL_NOW and MAX_SO_FAR
MAX_TILL_NOW=A[0]
MAX_SO_FAR=A[0]
